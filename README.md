# Deno-Google

## Drive

An easy way to access Google Drive without any external dependencies.

```ts
import { GoogleDrive } from "https://deno.land/x.google/google-drive.ts";

const gd = new GoogleDrive({
  client_id: "xxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com",
  client_secret: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  refresh_token: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  logger: false,
});

try {
  // This step can be omitted, and it will reauthorize when requesting data
  await gd.authorize();
  // The default value of the path is "root"
  const metadata = await gd.index("your/path");

  if (metadata.isFolder) {
    console.log(metadata.list());
  } else {
    // handle metadata.raw() or metadata.raw(range)
  }
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e);
}
```

## OAuth

This class is a simplification of the google oauth2 authorization flow.

### 1. Create an instance

```ts
import { GoogleOAuth } from "https://deno.land/x/google/google-oauth.ts";

const ga = new GoogleOAuth({
  client_id: "xxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com",
  client_secret: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  redirect_uri: "http://example.com/redirect_uri",
  "scopes": [
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email",
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly",
  ],
});

const link = ga.buildAuthLink();
```

### 2. Visit the link

After clicking the link to complete the authorization, it will redirect to the
uri with the "code" parameter. You can receive the "code" in redirect_uri.

### 3. Get tokens

```ts
// tokens include refresh_token, access_token, id_token, etc.
// But the access_token has an expiry time, so you need to get it again through the next step
const tokens = await ga.getTokens(code);
```

### 4. Get access_token

```ts
// refresh_token is obtained in the previous step, it is permanently valid.
const accessToken = ga.getAccessToken(refresh_token);
```

### 5. Decode id_token (without verifiy signature)

The id_token obtained in the third step contains some personal information of
the google account, you can decode it.

```ts
const data = ga.decodeIdToken(id_token);
// it will return { header, payload, signature }
// payload is the personal information
```

### 6. Decode id_token (verify signature via CERTS_URL)

It is usually not necessary to verify the signature for the first authorization,
but it is strongly recommended to verify when you use the id_token as a cookie
to keep the login state.

**NOTE: There is a bug in this method, which is caused by the type of
"cryptoKey", and I don't know how to solve it for the time being.**

```ts
const data = await ga.verifyIdToken(id_token);
```
